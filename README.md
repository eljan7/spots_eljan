Spots is a simple, elegant web page built to practice core HTML & CSS concepts.
It features a profile section and a gallery of cards that display beautiful landscape images with titles and interactive “like” buttons.
The layout is fully responsive, visually balanced, and built using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques.



Technologies & Techniques Used

HTML5 — semantic structure (header, main, section, footer)

CSS3 — Flexbox and Grid for layout

BEM methodology — consistent naming convention

Responsive design — adapts to different screen widths

Accessibility — alt text, aria labels, and clean structure

Media optimization — object-fit, lazy-loading, and text-overflow: ellipsis
